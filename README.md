# Rubiks_Cube_ML

This is a rough draft of an attempt to solve a rubik's cube using a neural network. Currently, it uses a brute force approach to try to solve it. 
At a depth of 5, it was able to get loss down to ~0.8 over 2,000,000 random training points.

Plan to implement MCTS with an algorithmic approach to finish solving the cube instead of random inputs, in order to be more efficient and effective at solving it.
Ideally I can use the same logic as AlphaGo to get this to work, but has yet to be implemented.
